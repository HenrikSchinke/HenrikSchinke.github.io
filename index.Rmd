You have reached the website of Henrik Schinke. Currently, I am doctoral student at the [university hopsital](https://www.lmu-klinikum.de/) in Munich. My research mainly focuses on signaling pathways and cellular programs of cancer. A great benefit of being affiliated to a hospital is the close proximity to clinical routine. Thus, I focus on investigations which can help improve cancer therapy. And I believe *R* can be a great ally for this purpose. 


Here, I want to publish recent work and projects worth sharing.
